GitHub secrets are not passed to pull requests: Therefore all tests that rely on secrets
must be turned off when Actions are run for an incoming PR. This in turn leads to
codecov complaining about reduced coverage with a patch.

Thus all tests that rely on secrets are implemented in this single file which is
ignored for codecov analysis by suitably setting ignore paths in codecov.yml
